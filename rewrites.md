# Rewrites Are Sometimes a Good Idea

Joel Spolsky once said that the single worst mistake a software company can make is rewriting the code from scratch. Ever since then, this idea seems to have been enshrined as gospel. I'm not sure why. I've been involved in a successful rewrite or two, and still think that those rewrites were the best decisions we could have made. I'll blog about those rewrites at some point. But right now, I want to start a fresh conversation about rewrites.

## Survivorship bias

As mentioned, I've led some successful rewrites, but maybe I was just lucky. Maybe my thoughts are shaped mostly by survivorship bias. Then again, Joel also has survivorship bias. He witnessed a failed rewrite and decided that rewrites are always bad.

So, the question is: is there some more objective source we can point to that demonstrates whether or not rewrites are always bad?

I think so.

## Every successful company that wasn't first-to-market

Every new product that enters an existing market is a from-scratch rewrite of the competition. Just because it's not the exact same company doing the rewrite doesn't mean that it's not a rewrite. From that perspective, Joel himself has been involved in some wildly successful rewrites.

StackOverflow is a from-scratch rewrite of Experts Exchange. Trello is a from-scratch rewrite of any number of other project management apps. Google was a from-scratch rewrite of Yahoo search. Facebook was a from-scratch rewrite of Friendster. Linux was a from scratch rewrite of Unix. iOS was a from-scratch rewrite of Blackberry OS.*

StackOverflow, Google, Facebook, Linux, and iOS could have been spun up as internal teams within Experts Exchange, Yahoo, Friendster, AT&T, and Blackberry. But they weren't. The real question is, "Why does it take a new company and team to do a successful rewrite?"

## Turning the Titanic

My successful rewrites were always done by a new team that was essentially able to act as a brand new company within an older organization. My failed projects always involved a long-established team. (To be honest, I've never had a failed rewrite, though I suspect that if I did, it would be as part of an established team.)

A good rewrite requires breaking out of the ruts that got you into the mess in the first place. And organizational ruts are really, really hard to break out of. Once you've been somewhere long enough, it's really hard to step back and get a clear perspective. The ruts become too dominant in your vision.

It's hard to take an existing company / team and turn them around. It's hard to get even one person-- much less an entire team-- to think differently about a subject. It's even harder if it's a subject that they are close to- and it's hard not to be emotionally close to something you've spent years of your life building.

I think this is the real reason behind the idea that internal rewrites are generally a bad idea, but external rewrites aren't.
