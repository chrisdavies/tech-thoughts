## The thoughts


* ### [Travis CI is awesome](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/travis-ci-is-awesome.md)

  Integrating a project with Travis CI is easier than anticipated.
* ### [A foray into Clojure](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/a-foray-into-clojure.md)

  A bug hunt ended with an exploratory venture into a unique programming language, Clojure. 
  
* ### [Performance testing Rails vs Phoenix](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/asp-vs-rails-vs-phoenix.md)

  Some benchmark tests with two popular frameworks.
* ### [Requiring an entire directory with browserify](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/browserify-include-directory.md)

  How to require the entire controllers director in your gulpfile for single-page-apps.
  
* ### [From Engineer to Web Developer](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/from-engineer-to-web-developer.md)

  After 16 years of experience as a professional programmer, I no longer ask myself, "What is the root problem we're trying to solve? What is the best way to solve it?". Here's why not. 
  
* ### [Loading templates into a JavaScript object](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/gulp-bundling-templates.md)

  Folderify-like function to recursively crawl a directory, and put the content of each .html file into a hash, and generate a JavaScript file with the content of the hash as the export.

  "Late in my dad's career, he was asked to turn around a manufacturing facility that was bleeding money at the rate of roughly $150,000,000 per year. While touring the facility, he noticed a critical machine sitting idle.
"Why isn't that running?" he asked...

* ### [Prototypal Objects vs Object Literals](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/prototypal-vs-literal.md)

  Benchmark tests - showing prototypal inheritance outperforms object literal alternatives
  
* ### [Rewrites Are Sometimes a Good Idea](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/rewrites.md)

  Debunking the myth that rewrites are (always) bad.
  
* ### [Skinny Controllers](https://github.com/fieldse/tech-thoughts/blob/master/skinny-controllers.md)

  Fat controllers aren't the problem; why the MVC "skinny controller" concept is erroneous.
