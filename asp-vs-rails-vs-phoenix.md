# Performance testing the frameworks

I recently put this perf test together:

https://github.com/chrisdavies/framework_perf_tests/blob/master/readme.md

.NET performed admirably, but the development process was far from smooth. VS Code on Mac provides a decent environment, when it's all tricked out with the right plugins, but things still feel rough around the edges. I gave up on Entity Framework with MySQL. I gave up on F# in ASP.NET Core. 

Getting Suave.io to play nice with core prooved difficult, too. I was able to get "Hello World" running, but no templating. It had too many dependencies on the *real* .NET.

I'm hoping that .NET Core matures quickly, and that F# becomes a first-class citizen. If F# ever becomes a first-class citizen, and not an afterthought, I'll be pushing more of my development onto that stack.

As is, I'm still searching for a tech stack that feels right. Elixir is close. I think I'd miss currying, though.
